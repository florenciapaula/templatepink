        <p>
          Face serums are lightweight products that contain a high concentration
          of active ingredients. They absorb quickly into your skin, making them
          an excellent next step after cleansing. There are many different types
          of serums, each with a unique purpose and ingredients. Some serums
          help to brighten your skin or reduce blemishes, while others focus on
          boosting hydration or fighting the signs of aging. Some serums work
          better in the morning, while others work best when applied in the
          evening. If you’re not sure if a face serum is right for you, or which
          type to use for your skin, talk to a board certified dermatologist for
          more information.
